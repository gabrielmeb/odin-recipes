    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>Fire up the grill and savor the smoky goodness of BBQ chicken. This recipe will guide you through the steps to create tender, flavorful barbecue chicken that's perfect for your next outdoor cookout.</p>

   <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
   <ul>
    <li>4 bone-in, skin-on chicken quarters (legs and thighs)</li>
    <li>1 cup (240ml) BBQ sauce</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon paprika</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon onion powder</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon black pepper</li>
</ul>
    <h4> Steps:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your grill to medium-high heat and oil the grates to prevent sticking.</li>
        <li>In a small bowl, mix together the vegetable oil, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and black pepper to create a spice rub.</li>
        <li>Pat the chicken quarters dry with paper towels, then rub the spice mixture all over the chicken, making sure to coat each piece evenly.</li>
        <li>Place the seasoned chicken on the preheated grill, skin side down, and cook for about 6-8 minutes, or until the skin is crispy and has grill marks.</li>
        <li>Flip the chicken and grill for another 6-8 minutes, or until the internal temperature reaches 165°F (74°C) and the juices run clear.</li>
        <li>During the last few minutes of grilling, baste the chicken with BBQ sauce, allowing it to caramelize and develop a delicious glaze.</li>
        <li>Once the chicken is cooked and the sauce is nicely caramelized, remove it from the grill and let it rest for a few minutes.</li>
        <li>Serve your mouthwatering BBQ chicken and enjoy the flavors of outdoor grilling!</li>
    </ol>
