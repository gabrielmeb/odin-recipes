   <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
   <ul>
    <li>2 cups (8 ounces) elbow macaroni</li>
    <li>2 cups (8 ounces) shredded sharp cheddar cheese</li>
    <li>1/2 cup (2 ounces) grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    <li>3 cups (720ml) milk</li>
    <li>1/4 cup (4 tablespoons) unsalted butter</li>
    <li>1/4 cup (30g) all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon black pepper</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon paprika</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon dry mustard (optional)</li>
    <li>1/2 cup (60g) breadcrumbs (for topping, optional)</li>
</ul>
    <h4> Steps:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook the macaroni: In a large pot, boil the macaroni according to the package instructions until it's al dente. Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>Make the cheese sauce: In the same pot, melt the butter over medium heat. Stir in the flour to create a roux. Cook for a couple of minutes until it's lightly browned.</li>
        <li>Gradually add the milk to the roux while continuously whisking to avoid lumps. Cook and stir until the mixture thickens, usually about 5-7 minutes.</li>
        <li>Reduce heat and add shredded cheddar cheese and grated Parmesan cheese. Stir until the cheese is completely melted and the sauce is smooth.</li>
        <li>Season the cheese sauce with salt, black pepper, paprika, and dry mustard (if using). Adjust the seasonings to your taste.</li>
        <li>Combine the cooked macaroni with the cheese sauce and mix thoroughly.</li>
        <li>Optional breadcrumb topping: Preheat your oven's broiler. Transfer the macaroni and cheese to an oven-safe dish, sprinkle breadcrumbs on top, and broil for a few minutes until the breadcrumbs are golden brown and crispy.</li>
        <li>Serve hot and enjoy your homemade macaroni and cheese!</li>
